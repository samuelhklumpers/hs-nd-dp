We want to get a working build for the smallest cost:

min f = sum_i c_i * s_{c,i}^{n_i}
where g = sum_i h_i * s_{h,i}^{n_i} > h

    NB: You want to minimize the cumulative price
    c_i * (1 - s_{c,i}^{n_i + 1}) / (1 - s_{c,i})
    = c_i * s_{c,i}^{n_i} * s_{c,i} / (s_{c, i} - 1) - c_i / (1 - s_{c,i})
    Hence minimizing c_i * s_{c,i}^{n_i}
    where c_i -> c_i * s_{c,i} / (s_{c, i} - 1) is equivalent

The Lagrangian is then:
L = f - k * (g - h)

Taking a derivative simplifies the equation:
dL/d{n_i} = c_i * log(s_{c, i}) * s_{c,i}^{n_i}
          - k * h_i * log(s_{h, i}) * s_{h,i}^{n_i} = 0

Rewriting:
log(c_i) + log(log(s_{c,i})) + log(s_{c,i}) * n_i
= log(k) + log(h_i) + log(log(s_{h, i})) + log(s_{h,i}) * n_i

n_i * (log(s_{c,i}) - log(s_{h,i})) = log(k) + log(h_i) - log(c_i) + log(log(s_{c,i})) - log(log(s_{h,i}))
n_i * log(s_{c,i} / s_{h,i}) = log(k * h_i / c_i * log(s_{c,i}) / log(s_{h, i}))

n_i = log(k * h_i / c_i * log(s_{c,i}) / log(s_{h, i})) / log(s_{c,i} / s_{h,i})

You _could_ now solve:
    sum_i h_i * s_{h,i}^{n_i} = h

    s_{h,i}^{n_i} = exp(log(s_{h,i})n_i) 
    = exp(n_i * (log(s_{c,i}) - log(s_{h,i})))^x_i
    where x_i = log(s_{h,i}) / (log(s_{c,i}) - log(s_{h,i})) = log(s_{h,i}) / log(s_{c,i}/s_{h,i})

    = (k * h_i / c_i * log(s_{c,i}) / log(s_{h, i}))^{x_i}
    = k^{x_i} * y_i
    where y_i = (h_i / c_i * log(s_{c,i}) / log(s_{h, i}))^{x_i}

But there's no real point:

n_i = log(k) / log(s_{c,i} / s_{h,i}) + log(h_i / c_i * log(s_{c,i}) / log(s_{h, i})) / log(s_{c,i} / s_{h,i})

just trial for log(k)

1. what if something has a compound cost s_a^n + s_b^n?
2. what if circulators?
